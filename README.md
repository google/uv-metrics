`uv-metrics` is a Python library that makes it easy to instrument your machine
learning workflows, report those metrics to a variety of storage backends, and
analyze those metrics in a notebook or script.

UV is designed to work in or out of a Dockerized environment. It was designed
alongside [Caliban](https://github.com/google/caliban), and interacts nicely
with Caliban's job history management features to make metrics easier than ever.

## Installation and Usage
